# Clojure-Flavored ALTTPR Item Tracker

Yet another item tracker for [A Link to the Past Randomizer](https://alttpr.com/en). There's nothing terribly special about this version except for it being implemented with Clojurescript, Reagent, and Electron. This project is based off the [cljs-electron](https://github.com/Gonzih/cljs-electron) starter.

## Running it

```shell
npm install electron -g # install electron binaries

lein cooper                      # compile cljs and start figwheel
electron .                       # start electron from another terminal
```

## Features

This is really just a personal project, mainly to explore Clojurescript in a comfortable domain. I don't plan to make this a fully-featured competitor to the existing trackers out there, but I won't rule it out either.

## Prior Art

This project is heavily influenced by work done by [crossproduct](https://www.twitch.tv/crossproduct), [orphis](https://alttp.orphis.net/), and the entire [alttpr](https://alttpr.com/en) community.
